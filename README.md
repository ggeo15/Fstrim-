# What will this module do?

This Magisk module optimizes your Android device's internal storage by clicking the magisk v28 action button and periodically running the fstrim command on multiple partitions. fstrim helps free up unused memory blocks, maintaining system performance over time.

# Functionality:

Run fstrim on the main partitions, including /data, /cache, /system, and /vendor (if available).

# Notice:

Use with caution, as fstrim directly modifies storage. Recommended for users who want to improve system performance and have experience with flash storage.
